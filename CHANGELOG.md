### Changed

## [0.5.0] - 2023-04-19

### Changed

- Output of for LDAP user via the sub command list is now presented in a nicer ASCII table format
- CLI argument for slurm, ldap and directory management can be toggled via cli and conf.toml individually CLI Option for a system is only available if a sub command supports it. slurm-only, ldap-only and dirs-only were replaced by new options
- LDAP bind OU and general LDAP OU are more configurable.
  One can now specify several dn parts like ou=people,ou=department.
  Before one could only specify a value for one fixed dn key part like people => ou=people.

### Added

- Added possibility to output listing of LDAP user via pretty table format and the old machine-readable format via CLI flag in subcommand list
- Used base dc, dn for user manipulation and dn for user bind are now logged.
- Port for ssh connection can now specified via configuration file

## [0.6.0] - 2023-11-08

### Changed

- Configuration file is not created automatically anymore
- Username and passwords which are empty or only white spaces and have default value are invalid 
- Output of for LDAP user via the sub command list is now presented in a nicer ASCII table format
- CLI argument for slurm, ldap and directory management can be toggled via cli and conf.toml individually
  CLI Option for a system is only available if a sub command supports it.
  slurm-only, ldap-only and dirs-only were replaced by new options
- LDAP bind OU and general LDPA OU are more configurable. 
  One can now specify several dn parts like ou=people,ou=department.
  Before one could only specify a value for one fixed dn key part like people => ou=people.

### Added

- Subcommands can be issued via shortcuts which consists of one or two letters.
- Configuration file can be located in several places. 
  It always try user specific configuration locations, then system configuration places and the CWD as the last resort.
- Default configuration can be generated via new subcommand "generate-config".
- Option to try authentication via ssh agent before simple password authentication.
- Added option to use different user prefix and org unit binding for readonly LDAP user.
- Made username and password optional for readonly user to allow for prompting these credentials.
- Used base dc, dn for user manipulation and dn for user bind are now logged.
- Port for ssh connection can now specified via configuration file

### Fixed

- CLI tool now enforces the following:
  - Default Qos must be contained in the collection of Qos for the operations add, remove and modify
  - Default Qos along with the collection of Qos must be given both or none of them for the operations add, remove and modify.
- This prevents the problem where sacctmgr CLI, slurm CLI, did not update default Qos or collection of Qos.
- The prompt showing allowed number for selection for several keys under ssh agent is now correctly displayed. 
  Before the maximum index selection was too big by one.
- Fixed faulty determining inside os config folder space. 
  Example: before It searched under ~/.config instead of ~/.config/usermgmt

[0.6.0]: https://github.com/th-nuernberg/usermgmt/releases/tag/v0.6.0 


## [0.6.1] - 2024-12-14

### Added

- Added conf field "`ldap_add_created_at`" to opt in for creating LDAP users with creation date
  Note: the field value field "`createdAtRole`" under the array field "`objectclass_common`" is needed
  in the config file. Otherwise one gets an error while creating an LDAP user. 
- Added configuration field "`ldap_default_user`". Allows to define username for LDAP login used by default.
- Added CLI option to specify the configuration file
- Logging also performed to logging file
- SSH key pair can be provided by field within configuration file or as a CLI argument.

### Changed

- In CLI, connection to LDAP and Slurm is checked before any attempt at performing adding/removing/listing or modifying/listing.
- In CLI, user can just press enter to provide no password during password prompt for SSH (useful for ssh key pair without password).

- Some typos
